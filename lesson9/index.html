        <p>Mountainous areas south of Pocatello will continue to see snow through Thursday morning from a storm that entered East Idaho on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The National Weather Service is forecasting at least one to three inches of snow from the storm for places with elevations higher than 5,000 feet that are south of the Gate City. This includes the cities of Montpelier, Soda Springs and Lava Hot Springs.</p>
        <p>The Wasatch mountains between Preston and Bear Lake are predicted to receive the most snow, with a storm total of three to five inches expected Wednesday to Thursday morning.</p>
        <p>No more than a quarter-inch of snow is forecast to fall during that time frame on most of East Idaho's lower elevation areas, including Pocatello, Idaho Falls and Rexburg.</p>
        <p>East Idaho will not see snow again until Sunday, when the weather service says another storm will pass through the region. That storm should exit East Idaho by Monday night.</p>
        <p>The weather service says there is the potential for a third storm to bring more snow to East Idaho next Wednesday into Thanksgiving on Thursday</p>
        <p>The weather service is not yet ready to predict how much snow will fall on East Idaho as a result of next week's storms.</p>
        <p>Temps will gradually cool in East Idaho as Thanksgiving approaches, with daytime highs expected to be around freezing in East Idaho next week.</p>
